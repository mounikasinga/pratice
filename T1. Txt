love the idea! We can take all our festive outfits, light some diyas, and get some great group pictures. It'll be like our own little Diwali celebration away from home.
we can even plan a little Diwali party with snacks, music, and our own decorations. Imagine the photos we could get with all the lights and diyas around.
Diwali under the stars, away from the city. This is going to be the best Diwali ever!
